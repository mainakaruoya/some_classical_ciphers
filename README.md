## (Some) Classical Ciphers
This repository contains implementations of some classical ciphers in Python. Specifically, this repository has:
- The Shift cipher (which is a generalization of the Caesar cipher);
- The Simple Substitution cipher;
- The Vigen√®re cipher; and,
- The Playfair cipher.

As an example of how to brute-force a message encrypted using the Shift cipher, the script `shift_cipher_bruteforce.py` tests all possible shift values (0-25) for a Shift cipher and prints those results to the screen.

### Usage
To use a particular cipher, enter the following command (as an example, we'll use the Shift cipher file):

`python shift_cipher.py`

_Mutatis mutandis_ for the other scripts.
